                As wanderlusts and global citizens, we would urge ourselves to travel the world whether it be for leisure or self-discovery. Exchanging life stories with fellow globetrotters is typically the crescendo of my journey. Few things I have learned: people are chiefly good, circumstances force us to be otherwise, and there's depth of experience in each and every one of us.

                </p>
                <p>
                The tradition was brought on by  
                <strong>positive influences & negative experiences in my life.</strong> There is no question that the COVID-19 pandemic and a series of worldwide events had turned our lives upside down.

                When we hit rock bottom, the only way is up. Being human, we make mistakes (often due to indecision) and it's through honest introspection do we grow. This blog platform attempts to collect people's account and life experiences living the 'zenyaga' lifestyle, keeping a young and gifted spirit to overcome hardship, reminiscing and relating our great life experiences to uplift the spirits of people across the globe, as I have found it relevant in today's climate.</strong>

              Formal education teaches us to be contributing members of society, but life experiences are an entirely personal endeavour. Life experiences are color-blind, and cross borders. In relating inspiring stories by real life people, we hope to restore some semblance of hope in the lives of those who feel that they're lost and in need of replenishment in the form of connected and mindful sharing of life experiences that offer nuggets of wisdom to everyone no matter where they are in life. <a href="# ">Learn More</a>

              &ldquo;I was a party boy. I partied hard and hardly had the time to reflect. As my life starts to slow down, I had the opportunity to think about the deeper things in life. I have always found myself loving the Asian culture. Introspective, introverted and rich with values and meaning. Keeping my young and brave spirit, I had moved to South Korea during the pandemic to study and broaden my horizon. To find new experiences and enrich my inner-self. I still party by the way, just that now I've acquired a new langauge. ÏïàÎÖïÌïòÏÑ∏Ïöî!&rdquo;

I had used music to drown the noises in my head, of the sorrows I couldn't get past, damaging my life and relationships along the way. The pandemic had given me a real time to reflect through solitude, and one step at a time, my friends and family had started to accept me back into their lives.&rdquo;

                    &ldquo;Sometimes, it is easier to speak to strangers about your life woes in hopes of getting to some form of epiphany in our lives. There are certain expectations, and masks that we had put on in front of our close connections - family & friends. Finally, we reach a point where we tell ourselves that <i>enough is enough</i>, and we start to break. In my travels, I have met people who come from less fortunate circumstances than I have, yet they had maintained an optimistic life attitude. Somehow, exchanging these experiences has helped me see a different perspective, and restored a sense of gratitude into my life. &rdquo;
